Mandriva package repository access
==================================

If you do not have a Mandriva ssh account, you can still obtain easy
access to the Mandriva package repository by editing /etc/repsys.conf
and configuring the following settings:

  [global]
  mirror = http://svn.mandriva.com/svn/packages/cooker
  [log]
  oldurl = http://svn.mandriva.com/svn/packages/misc

It is then possible to check out and build packages (without the
changelog) using e.g.

  mdvsys co perl-IO-Null
  cd perl-IO-Null
  bm -l

or to directly extract an SRPM (with changelog) using

  mdvsys extract perl-IO-Null
